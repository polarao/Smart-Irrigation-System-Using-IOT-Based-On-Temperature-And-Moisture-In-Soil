<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p> In India, agriculture in villages plays an essential role in developing the country. Basically, agriculture depends on the monsoons which have not enough water source. To overcome this problem, the Smart Irrigation System using IOT based on temperature and moisture in soil is employed in the field of agriculture.</p>
